```

## 🛠️ Build Process
The production bundle (`app.js`) is automatically generated from the modular source code using:
```bash
npm run build        # Bundles all modules into app.js
```

## 📏 Code Quality Metrics
- **Average function length**: 15 lines
- **Maximum file complexity**: ContactForm.js (but well-structured)
- **Total source code**: ~933 lines across 6 well-organized modules
- **Comments-to-code ratio**: 25%
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one clear purpose

**For recruiters**: Please review the source files in `js/modules/` and `js/app-modular.js` to evaluate code quality. The `app.js` file is a production bundle generated by our build system.
